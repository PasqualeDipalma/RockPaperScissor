# RockPaperScissor
1st JavaScript project - Learning web development with https://www.theodinproject.com/

<h1>Description</h1>
We’re going to make a simple implementation of grade-school classic “rock paper scissors”. For the moment we’re just going to play the game from the browser console, but we will revisit this project in a later lesson and add a Graphical User Interface with buttons and text.

<h1>Final Result</h1>

This is the final result. It can be better for example displaying images of what computer plays, making some animations or having a better css style.
